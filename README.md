
This organization is for the participants of Oklahoma's ACI-REF Virtual Residency program.

See here: http://www.oscer.ou.edu/acirefvirtres2015.php  

The purpose of this repository is to collect knowledge about how to to our jobs better and to plan the next workshop.

The "issues" section resemble threads -- we can discuss things there and then perhaps make a wiki entry, or better yet a markdown file in the "Code" section. 


This code section gets rendered nicely if in markdown and benefits from all the normal version control goodness like being able to clone it to your local storage.  I don't know if the wiki goes anywhere but here which means if github goes away, we'd lose it.
